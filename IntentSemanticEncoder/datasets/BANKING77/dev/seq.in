$20 came out instead of $100
i asked for more cash than what was received
the correct amount of cash was not received.
my cash withdrawal was short.
i received the wrong amount of cash.
i made an atm withdraw it didn't give me the amount i asked for but is showing a withdraw for that amount.
i wanted to withdraw $100 from the atm but i only got $20
why didn't i receive the right amount of cash at the atm?
my cash balance less than what i thought
help, your app is showing a larger wd than i actually did earlier at an atm.
i didn't receive the correct amount of cash
the atm gave me less cash than requested
asked for $100 but only got $20. why would this happen?
hi, i used an atm today to take money out of my account, but the amount it gave me is not the amount i requested. what should i do?
i withdrew $100 but only received $20
when i went to $100, all the machine would give me was $20.
hi, i draw out some money from the atm today. the atm has given me wrong amount and the application is displaying more amount than i withdraw.
hey i am standing in front of an atm here, it only gave me 10 pounds even though i wanted to withdraw 30! seems like the app has 30 pounds, what do i do??
the amount of cash i received did not match the amount i requested
help! i tried to get cash and it gave me some, but not the right amount!
i selected to withdrawal 30 pounds but only received 10. i'm still standing in front of the atm. the app shows i took out 30 pounds also. how do i fix this?
i was not distributed the correct amount of cash that i asked for
i got the incorrect amount of money given to me from my account
what happened! i asked for 30 pounds at your atm and only go 10. the machine lied about it too. it said i received the full 30 pounds. someone better help me asap on this.
who should i contact if the amount of my withdrawal doesn't correspond to the amount that i tried to take out of my account?
the atm didn't give me what i asked for but my balance says it did
i didn't get all the cash i asked for
i went tot the atm earlier today and didn't realize this till now but i did not get all the money i requested.  i believe my account was charged for 100 but i only got 80.  is there any way we can solve this problem?
a wrong amount of cash we sent to me.
how can i request cash back? the atm just gave me a different amount than what i've been actually charged though...
