help me. there is a direct debit that I did make.
there is no direct debit that's not mine.
i have a normal direct debit in my statement
i understand where this debit came from and don't want it removed.
this charge on my account is not recognized
im not mad right now. theres no charges that i think my x boyfriend made on my card. the companys on the website refunded me my money, they didn't tell me to contact my bank. no need to do something.
no one stole my money
there's no direct debit payment in my account that i didn't make
there's a debit on my account that i did do.
i don't have a fraud charge on my debit statement.
why is there a direct debit payment on my app that is from me?
normal charges are appearing in my debit account.
even though it's late, i don't want to see about disputing a charge. i was just looking through my transactions over the past couple of months and noticed a pretty large amount that was not completed by me. this is not possibly something i can still do.
there was a transaction from two weeks ago from a business that i don't know. i'm fairly certain it wasn't me who made it, and it is not an option to trace it to confirm.
what is this direct debit i am not seeing?
there is a direct debit that i recognize.
known direct deposit
there is no suspicious direct debit payment.
there is a transaction from my account that i recognize can you trace back the information so i can make sure it's something i did or not?
a couple weeks ago some money was deducted from my account by some seller that i don't remember. i'm pretty sure i did that, but it is not possible to trace back who that is just to make sure.
i found a charge for a direct debit that was made by me.
i am not seeing a weird payment showing up that i know i did not make, no need to get it cancelled.
this direct debit payment may be right.
why does the app not show a direct debit payment that i did not authorize
i cannot dispute a payment even if i notice it several weeks after it was made.
it seems there is a correct listing of a direct debit payment on my app that i did make
i think i made this charge on my debit statement.
i have a direct debit charge that i recognize
i made this direct debit transaction
there's a direct debit on my account that i did authorize
i understand that this is extremely late. after going over my transactions for the last couple of months i noticed a large charge that i'm sure i did make. there is no need to dispute this.
i recognize a debit payment that was made and don't need to find out about the payment.
i am not concerned about the security in my account and do not want to make a dispute.
why is there a direct debit i made showing in the app?
there is a direct debit i recognise in my statement
i have a direct debit transaction i have set up, but would not like to.
no one has taken my money and i know who
i was not charged on my account that shouldn't be there.
there's no direct debit i wish to dispute
my account was not deducted from a seller when i didn't approve of it.

i have only one charge on the same transaction.
looks like my card payment was not duplicated. i went to pay at the store earlier, got declined once,second time it works. app still stays pending for one of the payments. there is no need to remove one of them as it's not wrong and clearly was not declined.
i have a transaction that shows only once
i recently got charged once from a restaurant that i was at this week and i would like for the payment to stay in my account.
there is only one of the same transaction on my account.
i don't have a duplicate payment showing

the exchange rate was not different when i withdrew my cash.
when i got cash, my exchange rate was correct.
there will be additional costs if i make a withdrawal from a local atm of british pounds. i don't need any cash to feel comfortable on the journey home.
it seems i was not overcharged when i used an atm while on vacation. even if i knew about your fees in advance i sure would have gone somewhere else.
i checked the exchange rate when i withdrew cash. and the actual rate that you applied was the same.
in receiving cash, the correct exchange rate was used for my transaction.
i cannot make a withdraw if i am out of country from with out any fees at an atm.
i took out a foreign currency and the exchange rate is correct.
i feel like the correct amount of money was taken during my currency exchange.
there was no error in exchange rate for my cash withdrawal
i don't need the right foreign money, at the right rate, at atms, when i go abroad.
the conversion rate on the atm that i used with foreign currency was correct.
the exchange rate for a foreign atm is not different
my cash withdrawal charged me the correct exchange rate
i withdrew some cash out of the atm over the holiday. it seems that i was not charged any outrageous fees. i would have done that had i been aware of these outrageous charges!
the exchange rate for my withdrawal is correct and matches the actual exchange rate.
can you explain your exchange rate policy? i think i received the correct amount of cash in my atm transaction.
my exchange rate was correct for a cash transaction.
i didn't expect a higher exchange rate when i withdrew money. no need to tell me current exchange rates.
the rate applied to my transaction was correct at the atm.
the rate of exchange is right for my cash withdrawal.
i took out cash abroad and the exchange rate is correct.
i used an atm in a foreign currency and the rate applied is correct!
how do you determine your exchange rates because one of yours was accurate when i got cash
i used the atm machine to get money out for holiday shopping and saw the correct charges. why is that? i would have used the atm if i had known!
the cash withdrawal exchange rate is correct.
there is no local atm that will provide british pounds, i have money for my homeward journey and feel comfortable waiting until i arrive in britain. a withdrawal will not involve extra charges.
