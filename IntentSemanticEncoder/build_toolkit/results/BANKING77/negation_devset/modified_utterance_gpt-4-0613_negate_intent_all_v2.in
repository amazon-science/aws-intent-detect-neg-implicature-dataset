i made a mistake when cancelling a payment, cancelling it from the wrong account number (with a typo) - can you please reinstate the transaction?
i intentionally made a payment from the correct account yesterday. it's my rent payment, and it's very large, so the account i paid from was able to cover the amount. it's really important that the payment be made from the right account.
yesterday, i cancelled a payment to the wrong account for my rent payment. i don't need this addressed as soon as possible and the funds transferred to the correct account by no later than tomorrow.
i think the transaction has gone through, why was the transfer cancelled?
i just realised i made the correct payment yesterday. there's no need to change it to another account. it's my rent payment and it's already in the right account.
i cancelled a transaction to a wrong account!
help! my transfer was cancelled unexpectedly before it's complete!
i don't need help. i didn't send my payment to the wrong account number. i didn't make a typo. please don't cancel the transfer. there is an option from the app.
i don't need to cancel my recent transfer, it was not a mistake. no help needed, let it go through.
i don't need to change a transfer.
i don't need a transfer cancelled.
i don't need help to revert a transaction i did this morning
my morning transaction doesn't need to be canceled.
i have a transaction and mistakenly cancelled it. Can it be reversed?
i don't need assistance in canceling a transfer which was a mistake. it does not need to be stopped.
how do i undo a mistakenly cancelled transaction?
i don't need to revert a transaction i did this morning.
i don't have to cancel a transfer i just made
i don't have to cancel a transfer
i have arranged a transfer and need to send it. there's no need to stop the transfer.
i meant to do the transfer, is there any way to undo the cancellation?
There's no need to fix an error in payment. I made a payment in the correct account yesterday and it doesn't need to be adjusted by tomorrow for my rent.
please help me, there is no transaction in the incorrect account.
i don't need to cancel my transfer, i paid it into the correct account. i have already paid it into the right account by tomorrow.
