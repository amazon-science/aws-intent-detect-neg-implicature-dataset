It often happens when the user is not familiar with the chatbot services. Therefore, the user only conveys the situation they have, but Chatbot needs to infer the intent that needs to be triggered. For example:\n\n[Example utterance 1] \"just found my old card\" can trigger intent \"how to link card to account\"\n[Example utterance 2] \"I haven't had breakfast\" can trigger intent \"suggest restaurant\"\n[Example utterance 3] \"Am I able to drive to Seattle from here?\" can trigger intent \"check gas amount\"\n\nBased on these examples, could you generate 3 implicature utterances for intent query_information_about_apple_pay_or_google_pay, under the below scenario? Please wrap your answers into a JSON object with keys like \"utterance_1\", \"utterance_2\", \"utterance_3\" and so on.\n{\n    \"role\": \"Customer with a lost or stolen device\",\n    \"situation\": \"The customer's device with Apple Pay or Google Pay enabled has been lost or stolen, and they want to know how to secure their bank account.\"\n}",
